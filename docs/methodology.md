# Methodology

## Assessment Framework

NeuroSpectrum implements a comprehensive screening methodology combining:

### 1. RAADS-R (Ritvo Autism Asperger Diagnostic Scale-Revised)
- Adult-focused autism screening
- 80-item clinical scale adapted to 14 core questions
- Emphasis on sensory processing and social cognition

### 2. CAT-Q (Camouflaging Autistic Traits Questionnaire)
- Measures social masking behaviors
- 3-factor structure: Compensation, Masking, Assimilation
- Critical for differential diagnosis

### 3. DSM-5 Criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorder
- Criterion A: Persistent deficits in social communication
- Criterion B: Restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior
- Criterion C: Symptoms present in early childhood

## Scoring Algorithm

The tool uses a weighted scoring system that:
- Applies clinical thresholds from validated instruments
- Implements differential diagnosis logic
- Flags potential stress/burnout mimics
- Provides percentile rankings for severity assessment

## Validation

Based on peer-reviewed research and clinical guidelines from:
- American Psychiatric Association (DSM-5)
- Ritvo et al. (RAADS-R validation studies)
- Hull et al. (CAT-Q development)

## Ethical Considerations

- No data collection or storage
- Client-side processing only
- Clear disclaimers about diagnostic limitations
- Encourages professional consultation
